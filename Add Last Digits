You will be given two numbers of int data-type as input, and you have to print the sum of their last digits as output.

Test Case 1:

Given Inputs: 2357 48986

Expected Output: 13

Explanation: The last digit of 2357 is 7 and the last digit of 48986 is 6, and the sum of these last digits is 13. Hence the output is 13.

Input Format

In the first line, first number will be given as input. In the second line, second number will be given as input.

Constraints

Both the numbers will be positive and will be in integer format.

Output Format

Print the sum in the line.

Sample Input 0

23456
9873
Sample Output 0

9
Explanation 0

Since the last digit of 23456 is 6, and the last digit of 9873 is 3. Therefore the sum is 6+3 or 9.
